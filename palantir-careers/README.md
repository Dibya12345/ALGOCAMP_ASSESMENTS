### My approach to the problem

- Figuring out the basic layout of the page

```html
<body>
  <header></header>
  <main>
    <section class="designation_container">
      <div></div>
    </section>
    <section class="designation_container_content">
      <form></form>
    <section>
  </main>
  <footer></footer>
</body>
```

- Making the header part ðŸ”¥
  For the header section, I planned to include a div within the header to contain the header image. This div will help in centering the image within the header.

```html
<header>
  <!-- parent  container -->
  <div class="header_container">
    <img src="anything.png" />
  </div>
</header>
```

The idea behind creating a div inside the header is to center it within the header. I know the width of my container (header_container) is 760px.

Here is an image demonstrating this setup:
